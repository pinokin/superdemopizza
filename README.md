A demo of a pizza ordering site

Shows an example how I would start building a javascript + HTML + CSS shopping cart feature.
The style is deliberately sketchy to say "this is demo!".
I'll probably use this project also in the future for practicing and trying out new stuff.

Some notes:
* Some of the menu items (the family sized pizzas) are fetched from a JSON file to mimic an actual database.
  (Yes, I just wanted to try that out.)

Nice to have features:
* Removing single items from cart
* Showing the total price on shopping cart and at checkout
* Selecting different "extras" on the pizza item in the menu (e.g. size, extra toppings, oregano, garlic, etc.)
